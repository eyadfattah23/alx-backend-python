# Python - Async 
## Resources

#### Read or watch:

* Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough
* asyncio - Asynchronous I/O
* random.uniform

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* `async` and `await` syntax
* How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create `asyncio` tasks
* How to use the `random` module

## Requirements
General

* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
* All files should end with a new line
* All files must be executable
* The length of files will be tested using wc
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
* All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
* All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
